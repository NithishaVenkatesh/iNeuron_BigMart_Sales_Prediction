## Project Overview

BigMart, a large retail chain, seeks to enhance its sales forecasting capabilities to improve inventory management and profitability. This project involves building a predictive model to estimate the sales of each product at different outlets. The model considers various factors, including product attributes and outlet characteristics, to make accurate predictions.
